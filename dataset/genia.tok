the

we
have
hypothes
that

in

we

the

thus

it

which

,
the

even
if

can

second
is
a

of

the
detail
of
the
regulatori

that
select

still

it
seem
that

in

,
the

accompani

the
loss

probabl
caus

and
may
be
a
manifest
of

is

,
neither
is
exact
the
same
phenomenon
that
occur
in
the
thymic

.

negat
select
in
the
cortex
appear
to
be
a
suicid
invers
of
antigen
respons
:
instead
of
turn
on
il-2
express
,
the
activ

destroy
it
own

.

the
gene
that
need
to
be
induc
for
this
respons
are
not
yet
identifi

but
it
is
unquestion
a
form
of
activ

it
is

that
in

these

this

when

it

to

the
possibl

get

insight
into

one
gene
of

wherea
the

for
these
reason
,
the
5'-flank

of
the

was
use
to
identifi
the
region
that
interact

a

capabl
of
control

the

thus
,
although
the

it

the

in

in

the
