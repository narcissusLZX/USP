:
a
repressor
of
lymphocyte
death
.

the
gene
and
mechanism
that
control
program
cell
death
be
currently
the
subject
of
intense
study
.

the
bcl-2
gene
,
a
repressor
of
lymphocyte
death
,
be
perhaps
the
best
understand
of
the
program
cell
death
associated
gene
.

here
,
stanley

provide
a
brief
overview
of
bcl-2
,
concentrate
on
its
role
in
b
-
and
t-cell
development
and
in
oncogenesis
