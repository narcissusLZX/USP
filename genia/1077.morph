regulation
of
the
beta-globin
locus
.

transcription
of
the
human
beta-globin
gene
cluster
depend
upon
upstream
regulatory
sequence
,
which
be
collectively
term
the
locus
control
region
.

recent
study
have
provide
new
insight
into
how
the
individual
gene
of
the
cluster
be
regulate
through
development
.

the
crux
of
transcriptional
activation
be
how
the
locus
control
region
communicate
with
the
gene-proximal
regulatory
element
.
