toremifene
on

.

toremifene
exert
multiple
and
vary
effect
on
the
gene
expression
of
human
peripheral
mononuclear
cell
.

after
short-term
,
in
vitro
exposure
to
therapeutical
level
,
distinct
change
in
p-glycoprotein
,
steroid
receptor
,
p53
and
bcl-2
expression
take
place
.

in
view
of
the
increase
use
of
antiestrogen
in
cancer
therapy
and
prevention
,
there
be
obvious
merit
in
long-term
in
vivo
study
to
be
conduct
.
