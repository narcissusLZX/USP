identification
of
nucleotide
sequence
that
regulate
transcription
of
the
mcf13
murine
leukemia
virus
long

repeat
in

cell
.

the
region
downstream

the
enhancer
-lrb-
den
-rrb-
of
the
long
terminal
repeat
of
the
mink
cell
focus-forming
murine
leukemia

be
important
for
viral
pathogenicity
.

another
important
activity
of
den
be
its
control
of
transcription
in
activate

,
and
we
have
determine
that
an
nf-kappab
site
be
critical
for
this
activity
.
