immune
response
to
adenovirus
:
viral
evasion
mechanism
and
their
implication
for
the
clinic
.

adenovirus
encode
protein
that
block
response
to
interferon
,
intrinsic
cellular
apoptosis
,
kill
by
cd8
-lrb-
+
-rrb-
cytotoxic
t
lymphocyte
and
kill
by
the
death
ligand
tnf
,
fa
ligand
and
trail
.

the
viral
protein
be
believe
to
prolong
acute
and
persistent
adenovirus
infection
.

the
protein
may
prove
useful
in
protect
adenovirus
gene
therapy
vector
and
transplant
cell
from
the
immune
system
.
